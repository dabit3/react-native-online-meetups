React Native Online Meetups
===

So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native.


## Link to the live stream:

TBC (around 7pm GMT)


### How I see it:

1. We get speakers, around 4-5 speakers per meetup
2. The session will last around an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. To be a speaker on a next meetup just send a PR to `interestedSpeakers.md` with your short bio and a very short outline of what you'd like to talk about.
5. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
6. More to follow, stay tuned!

### When:

The meetup will be organised whenever we will have enough speakers (4-5), still not sure how much interest this thing will get. Hoping for one every month.

* **Meetup 3rd November 2016**

  Yay! The first meetup is going to happen on the 3rd Novemeber 2016 at 8pm (GMT). I know that is not the best time for all of the timezones, but let's check how it goes this time and we will improve it later. The event is going to be **live streamed and recorded.**
  
  *Confirmed speakers:*
  - Gant Laborde
  - Leland Richardson
  - Truls Skeie
  - Mike Grabowski
  - Kumar Sanket
  - Parashuram

  Stay tuned!


#### SPEAKERS ONLY
